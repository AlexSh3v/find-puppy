Your heart skips a beat as you realize you're not alone...

There's a puppy out ther... and it's calling to you...

The puppy is waiting... but for how long?

### The Samsung IT School

I'm excited to share that I've completed the **Samsung IT School** program, graduating on <u>*June 2023*</u>! 

As part of the program, I developed a this game, which I presented to the class using [this presentation](files/find-puppy-presentation.pdf).

I'm proud to say that I not only completed the program, but I also received a Graduation Diploma for my hard work and dedication (just look at this):
